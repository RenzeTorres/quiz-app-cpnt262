Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader Quiz

## Overview
Using JavaScript, I made a quiz app filled with "Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader" type questions that are multiple choice.

## Features
I made it so that it shows the score at the end of the quiz and you are then able to restart with the quiz if you're unhappy with your score or if  you want to restart it just for fun. 

## Challenges
Had a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to include images in questions for example, if a question asks about a country, I would put a flag of that country or I would simply put an image that would provide a little bit of a hint.
